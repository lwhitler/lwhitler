Hello! My name Lily Whitler, I am a graduate student in astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Arizona where I work with Dan Stark studying galaxy formation and evolution in the early Universe. I graduated from Arizona State University in May 2020 with dual degrees in physics and math, with a focus in astrophysics. As an undergraduate, I was a member of the Low-Frequency Cosmology Lab, where I worked on understanding the Epoch of Reionization (when the hydrogen in the universe was ionized by the first stars and galaxies) via the 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen.

My pronouns are _she/her/hers_.
